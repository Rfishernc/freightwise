/**
       * Software Developer test.
       *
       * Doing research and making API calls are an important part of what we do at FreightWise.  This test will
       * demonstrate your abilities to:
       *
       * - Make an API call
       * - Research an API
       * - Do basic DOM manipulation
       * - Parse data
       * - Handle errors
       * - Be creative
       *
       * Feel free to ask any questions you may have.  Use a lot of comments, and explain why you are doing things.
       * Don't spend more than 1-2 hours on it - we aren't expecting a finished product, but it should work and look
       * nice.  Feel free to use any third party libraries, and if you do so, explain why you used them instead of
       * built in browser APIs.
       *
       * Instructions:
       * - Use the axios (https://github.com/axios/axios) request library to make an API call to the OpenWeatherMap
       *   API for Current Weather Data using this API key:  25e989bd41e3e24ce13173d8126e0fd6
       *   We've already imported this library to get you started.
       * - Use either async/await or Promises.
       * - Get the weather for Brentwood, TN, and write it to the DOM using the `setResults` method below.  Be
       *   creative and make it look nice.
       * - Handle errors and use the `setError` method below to display the error.  Also make it look nice.
       * - If you find any mistakes in the test, fix them, and leave a comment about what you fixed and why.
       * - Make sure your code is readable and maintainable.
       * - Use plenty of descriptive comments.
       * - Make sure your code runs in the latest version of Google Chrome and Firefox (ES6 is allowed).
       * - Make your code live (GitHub with GitHub pages works nice).
       * - Send a link to your finished test to hr+software@freightwisellc.com.
       *
       * If you have time, pick one of these:
       * - Sign up for NewsAPI.org and get the Top Headlines and show them along with the weather.
       * - Use the browser location API to get the user's current location, and show that location's weather.
       * - Show a satellite map of the weather in Brentwood.
       * - Request a user's phone number and send them an SMS with the weather.
